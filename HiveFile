Apache Hive: It is a data warehouse infrastructure based on Hadoop framework which is perfectly suitable for data summarization, analysis and querying. It uses an SQL like language called HQL (Hive query Language)
HQL: It is a query language used to write the custom map reduce framework in Hive to perform more sophisticated analysis of the data
Table: Table in hive is a table which contains logically stored data

Components of Hive:
Meta store: Meta store is where the schemas of the Hive tables are stored, it stores the information about the tables and partitions that are in the warehouse.
SerDe: Serializer, Deserializer which gives instructions to hive on how to process records
Hive interfaces:
Hive interfaces includes WEB UI
Hive command line
HD insight (windows server)
Hive Function Meta commands:
Show functions: Lists Hive functions and operators
Describe function [function name]: Displays short description of the particular function
Describe function extended [function name]: Displays extended description of the particular function
Types of Hive Functions:
UDF (User defined Functions): It is a function that fetches one or more columns from a row as arguments and returns a single value
UDTF (User defined Tabular Functions): This function is used to produce multiple columns or rows of output by taking zero or more inputs
Macros: It is a function that uses other Hive functions
User defined aggregate functions: A user defined function that takes multiple rows or columns and returns the aggregation of the data
User defined table generating functions: A function which takes a column from single record and splitting it into multiple rows
Indexes: Indexes are created to the speedy access to columns in the database

Syntax: Create index <INDEX_NAME> on table <TABLE_NAME>
Thrift: A thrift service is used to provide remote access from other processors
Meta store: This is a service which stores the metadata information such as table schemas
Hcatalog: It is a metadata and table management system for Hadoop platform which enables storage of data in any format.

Hive commands in HQL:
Data Definition Language (DDL):
It is used to build or modify tables and objects stored in a database
Some of the DDL commands are as follows:

To create database in Hive: create database<data base name>
To list out the databases created in a Hive warehouse: show databases
To use the database created: USE <data base name>
To describe the associated database in metadata: describe<data base name>
To alter the database created: alter<data base name>
Data Manipulation Language (DML):
These statements are used to retrieve, store, modify, delete, insert and update data in a database

Inserting data in a database: The Load function is used to move the data into a particular Hive table.
LOAD data <LOCAL> inpath <file path> into table [tablename]
Drop table: The drop table statements deletes the data and metadata from the table:
drop table<table name>
Aggregation: It is used to count different categories from the table :
Select count (DISTINCT category) from tablename;
Grouping: Group command is used to group the result set, where the result of one table is stored in the other:
Select <category>, sum( amount) from <txt records> group by <category>
To exit from the Hive shell: Use the command quit

Hive data types:
Integral data types:
Tinyint
Smallint
Int
Bigint
String types:
VARCHAR-Length(1 to 65355)
CHAR-Length(255)
Timestamp: It supports the traditional Unix timestamp with optional nanosecond precision
Dates
Decimals
Union type: It is a collection of heterogenous data types.
Syntax: UNIONTYPE<int, double, array<string>, struct<a:int,b:string>>
Complex types:
Arrays: Syntax-ARRAY<data_type>
Maps: Syntax- MAP<primitive_type, data_type>
Structs: STRUCT<col_name : data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...>
